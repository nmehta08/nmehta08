    "text": "I’m an amateur painter, poet, cook, candle maker, and more. As I journey through life, I explore activities that bring me joy and share them on my Instagram profile, as a way to capture these moments and the happiness they bring for later in life. My hobbies are my stress relievers and an important part of who I am, so my profile offers a glimpse into the things that truly inspire me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (Paintings and Sketches): Sketches and paintings are an integral part of my life, often reflecting the core of who I am. One of the most treasured gifts I’ve ever received was a Moleskine pocket notebook, which I’ve used to capture my sketches and paintings wherever I travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 (Mini-Candles): One of my favorite activities is visiting artisan markets wherever I go and picking up small handmade goods. For a Breast Cancer fundraiser in 2023, I tried my hand at making mini candles, which turned out to be a hit with everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 (My Chocolate Bar): When I first came to the States, one of the first movies I watched was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971 with Gene Wilder). I was always fascinated by how cooking could bring so much joy to people’s faces. Since then, I’ve considered myself an amateur chocolatier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4(My Meditation Video): “I am working to launch a small-scale mindfulness meditation program for my patients, focusing on simple techniques they can easily practice at home.

I earned my medical degree from the University of New England, College of Osteopathic Medicine, in 2019, and went on to complete a residency in Family Medicine until 2023. During my years of clinical training, I realized that my true calling lies in preventive medicine. I am passionate about helping people adopt healthier lifestyles and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes through education and lifestyle modification.\nAs part of my work, I guide patients in adopting healthier eating habits and creating personalized exercise routines that promote long-term well-being. I believe that prevention is key to improving public health, and I aim to incorporate innovative technologies, including bioinformatics, to help track, analyze, and optimize these interventions. My interest in technology comes from the desire to take a more data-driven, scalable approach to healthcare—especially as we move towards a more personalized, preventative model in medicine.\nOutside of work, I am deeply passionate about various creative pursuits, including cooking, sketching, poetry, and painting. My Instagram profile is a collection of memories that reflect these interests, as well as my philosophy on life. I enjoy working at my own pace and often find myself more productive in solo settings rather than large team environments. Recently, I’ve also become more involved in meditation, as I believe it not only enhances my personal well-being but can also be a valuable tool to offer my patients as part of a holistic approach to health.\nIn addition to my professional and creative pursuits, I am an avid reader with a particular fondness for the Tom Clancy series. However, my reading interests are eclectic, and I enjoy exploring books from a wide range of genres. My diverse interests and background in medicine drive my goal of integrating lifestyle medicine with technology, and I am excited to continue exploring how these fields can converge to improve the health of individuals and communities. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
